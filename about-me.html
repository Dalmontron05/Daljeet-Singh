            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>I'm a student at UAT, on my way to becomeing a video game developer. I mainly specialize in game programming, but I do care about and partake in game design and game art. I treat the latter two with equal priority</p>

            <h2>Hobbies</h2>
            <p>I have quite a few hobbies, but the one I definitely do the most is play video games. Wouldn't make too much sense to make video games if I didn't play them too. My favorite video game of all time is Far Cry 5. It's just got such an amazing story that hit hard when I first played it.<br><br>
            
            Besides that, I also Code. The webpages you're reading right now were actually made by me.<br>
            Even less often, I Draw, Read, and Write</p>
