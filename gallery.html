                It's a website with advanced tips for operators in the video game Tom Clancy's: Rainbow Six Siege. Each operator has a page dedicated to them. There are plenty of beginner guides and esports-level strategies available online. However, there isn't as much content for intermediate players (which is what the majority of the playerbase is at skill-wise).<br><br>
                Siege has a steep learning curve. If you want to have fun competitively, learning how the operators work on a deeper level can help you use or face against them.

                My cheap, but effective headless server is used to backup data with syncthing and host a minecraft server. I plan to soon turn it into a plex media center as well.

                I've created a terminal-based triva game themed around SCP using C++. You roleplay as a potential new hire in an interview. If you love SCP content, see how many questions you get right!

                While brainstorming some UI ideas for a game, I created this radial menu. As a graphic designer, I usually work digitally. However, this drawing shows how important these skills can be for game designers. It's usually easier to have visuals when showing someone your idea.
