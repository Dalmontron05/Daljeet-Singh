            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a student at UAT, on my way to becomeing a video game developer. I mainly specialize in game programming, but I do care about and partake in game design and game art. I treat the latter two with equal priority

        <h2>Hobbies</h2>
        <p>
            I have quite a few hobbies, but the one I definitely do the most is play video games. Wouldn't make too much sense to make video games if I didn't play them too. My favorite video game of all time is Far Cry 5. It's just got such an amazing story that hit hard when I first played it.<br><br>
        
            Besides that, I dabble in other forms of software engineering, such as web development, docker containers, shelling scripting, and more.
